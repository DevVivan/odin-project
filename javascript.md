# JavaScript Notes

## Objects

Objects are one of the eight data types in JavaScript that are used to store keyed connections of data. They usually contain an optional list of properties - a property being a '`key:value` pair'.

There are two main ways used to create empty objects, each with their own different syntaxes.

### Using 'object constructor' syntax

```javascript
let user = new Object();
```

### Using 'object literal' syntax

```javascript 
let user = {};
```
