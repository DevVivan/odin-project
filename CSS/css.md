## CSS Units

There are many different units that we can use to define sizes in CSS. These can be classified as absolute, or relative units.

### Absolute Units

Absolute units are those that are always the same in any context - they are not relative to anything else, and are generally considered to always be the same size. Some notable examples of absolute length units are as follows:

| Unit | Name                |
|------|---------------------|
| px   | Pixels              |
| cm   | Centimeters         |
| mm   | Millimeters         |
| Q    | Quarter-millimeters |
| in   | Inches              |
| pc   | Picas               |
| pt   | Points              |

Most of these units are more useful when used for print, rather than screen output. We typically only use px (pixels) for web development.
